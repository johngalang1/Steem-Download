To install STeem on your home machine:

1. Open the Home Steem.zip file
2. Copy the C and D folders to the C:\ drive
3. Copy the Steem shortcut to your desktop
4. Copy the Steem folder to the C:\Program Files (x86) folder

Steem should run with access to two harddrives C: and D: which are
mapped to the identically named folders on the Windows C:\ drive. 
When opening a file in Devpac it should default to the D drive (folder).

If you want you can re-map the D drive to anywhere you want using the
HD drawer icon on far right of the Steem toolbar.
